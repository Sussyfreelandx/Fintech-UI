## 🧱 Tech stack

- **Next.js 15** (App Router, React 18) — **pure JavaScript (no TypeScript)**
- **Tailwind CSS** (custom theme: ink/gold/neon, glass utilities, marquee + float animations)
- **Framer Motion** (page & micro animations)
- **lucide-react** (icons)
- **next-themes** (dark/light)
- Custom **SVG charts** (candlestick, sparkline, donut, bar) — no runtime canvas dependency, swap-in compatible with ApexCharts or TradingView widgets later
- **Real-time data** via Binance public REST + WebSocket (no API key required) — see `src/lib/useLiveData.js`

> The chart components are intentionally implemented with pure SVG so the bundle is small and the design is fully customizable. They are drop-in replaceable with ApexCharts (`react-apexcharts`) or the TradingView Advanced Charts widget when API keys / licenses are configured.

## 📡 Real-time market data

Everything price-related on AurumX is **live, not mocked**. We use the public Binance Spot APIs (no API key required):

| Source | Endpoint | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REST snapshot | `GET https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/24hr?symbols=[...]` | Market ticker, watchlist, asset cards, wallet valuations, positions (on load) |
| Live WebSocket | `wss://stream.binance.com:9443/stream?streams=<sym>@ticker/...` | Continuous 24h ticker updates (price, %, high, low, vol) |
| Klines REST | `GET /api/v3/klines?symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=5m&limit=80` | Candlestick chart history (hero + dashboard) |
| Klines WebSocket | `wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/<sym>@kline_<interval>` | Live candle updates (current candle ticks, new candle on close) |

The hooks live in `src/lib/useLiveData.js`:

```js
import { useLivePrices, useLiveKlines, DEFAULT_TICKER_SYMBOLS } from '@/lib/useLiveData';

const prices  = useLivePrices(['BTCUSDT', 'ETHUSDT', 'SOLUSDT']);
const candles = useLiveKlines('BTCUSDT', '5m', 80);
```

Both hooks ship with seed values so the UI renders instantly during SSR / first paint and then upgrades to live data once the WebSocket connects. If the connection ever drops the seed values keep the screen usable.

## 🚂 Deploy to Railway

This repository is configured for **Railway** out of the box:

- `railway.json` — Nixpacks builder, health-check on `/`, auto-restart on failure
- `nixpacks.toml` — pins Node 20, runs `npm ci && npm run build`
- `Procfile` — `web: npm run start`
- `package.json` `start` script binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT` (Railway sets `$PORT` automatically)

### One-time setup

1. Create a new project on [railway.app](https://railway.app) and connect this GitHub repo.
2. Railway will auto-detect Node + Next.js via Nixpacks.
3. **Attach a Railway Volume** mounted at `/data` (this is where AurumX stores users, transactions, withdrawal tokens, and the email outbox — without a volume the data is lost on every redeploy). Then set `DATA_DIR=/data` in **Variables**.
4. Set the rest of the env vars below.
5. Click **Deploy** — Railway will run `npm ci && npm run build`, then `npm run start`.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATA_DIR` | yes (prod) | Path to the writable volume (e.g. `/data`). Defaults to `./data` in dev. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | yes (prod) | 32+ char random string used to HMAC-sign session cookies. |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | yes | Auto-bootstraps an admin account on first login. |
| `APP_URL` | recommended | Public URL used in email CTAs (e.g. `https://aurumx.app`). |
| `SMTP_HOST` `SMTP_PORT` `SMTP_USER` `SMTP_PASS` `SMTP_SECURE` `EMAIL_FROM` | optional | If set, deposit / withdrawal / token / invest emails are delivered via SMTP. If unset, every email is still written to the **outbox** at `data/outbox.json` so you can verify what was sent. |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | optional | BotFather token for the admin Telegram bot. |
| `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | optional | Random string Telegram echoes back in the `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header. |
| `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_CHAT_IDS` | optional | Comma-separated Telegram chat IDs that are allowed to send admin commands. |

### CLI alternative

```bash
npm i -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

The first build takes ~2-3 minutes. After it goes live, attach a custom domain (e.g. `aurumx.app`) from the Railway dashboard.

## 💵 How users invest, deposit & withdraw

AurumX persists real account state on the server — users, balances, transactions, admin-issued withdrawal tokens, and admin-published deposit wallet addresses — all stored as JSON in `$DATA_DIR` (Railway volume in production).

### Live crypto markets (`/dashboard`)

Every supported asset — currently 29 (BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, BNB, ADA, DOGE, AVAX, DOT, LINK, MATIC, TRX, LTC, TON, ATOM, NEAR, APT, ARB, OP, SUI, FIL, INJ, SHIB, PEPE, BCH, ETC, XLM, ALGO, HBAR) — is displayed on the dashboard with **live Binance 24h ticker data** (price, 24h change, 24h high/low, 24h quote volume). Each row has an **Invest** button that opens the invest modal pre-filled for that asset.

### Funding the account (admin-published deposit addresses)

Admins publish a wallet address per asset from the admin dashboard (**Live admin operations → Deposit addresses**) or via Telegram (`/address BTC bc1q… network=BTC label="Cold storage A"`). Every signed-in user immediately sees the address on their dashboard in a "Deposit crypto" panel with a one-click copy button, the network, memo/tag (e.g. for XRP, ATOM), and the admin's label. When the deposit clears, an admin credits the user (see below) and the deposit shows up in the user's transaction history with the asset, amount, and live USD value.

### Invest in any crypto

1. User signs in and clicks **Invest** on `/dashboard` (or **Invest** on any markets row).
2. They pick an asset and a USD amount.
3. AurumX fetches the **live Binance price** server-side, debits the user's USDT balance, credits the crypto, records a `tx` entry, and emails the user a branded confirmation showing the exact crypto amount + USD value + fill price.

### Deposit (admin-credited)

1. Off-ramp / wire is received externally.
2. An admin signs in to `/admin` and uses **Live admin operations → Credit deposit**, *or* sends `/credit alice@example.com BTC 0.05 "wire #4421"` to the Telegram bot.
3. AurumX credits the user, records a `tx`, and emails the user with the asset, crypto amount, indicative USD value, and timestamp. The deposit appears in the user's dashboard transaction history within seconds.

### Performance / yield adjustments

Admins can apply a signed adjustment to any user's position from **Live admin operations → Adjust balance** (or `/adjust alice@example.com BTC +0.012 "Q2 yield"` in Telegram). The change is recorded as a transaction of type `adjust`, surfaces on the user's dashboard in real time, and the user receives an email explaining the reason.

### Real-time testimonials

Once a user has at least one completed invest, deposit, or adjustment, they unlock the **"Share your AurumX experience"** form on the dashboard. Submissions are persisted to the server, listed live on the landing page (`/`) every 30 s, and admins can approve / reject / delete them from **Live admin operations → Testimonials**. Set `AUTO_APPROVE_TESTIMONIALS=false` if you want manual moderation (default: auto-approve).

### Withdraw (token-gated)

Every withdrawal must be authorised by a one-time token that **only admins can issue**:

1. User requests a withdrawal in-app or via the Telegram support button.
2. An admin opens `/admin` → **Issue token** (or runs `/issue_token alice@example.com BTC 0.5` in Telegram). The token can be unrestricted or scoped to a specific symbol and max amount.
3. AurumX emails the token to the user.
4. The user opens **Withdraw** on `/dashboard`, fills in symbol / amount / destination address, pastes the token, and submits.
5. AurumX validates the token (status, owner, symbol scope, max amount), debits the crypto, marks the token `used`, records a `tx`, and emails the user a branded withdrawal confirmation.

The same token can never be reused. Admins can revoke active tokens at any time from `/admin` or via `/revoke <code>` in Telegram.

---

## 🤖 Telegram admin bot

The bot lets admins run the platform end-to-end from Telegram — no need to open the dashboard for routine operations.

### Setup

1. Create a bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) → copy the token into `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.
2. Generate a random string and put it in `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
3. Get your Telegram chat ID (DM [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)). Put it in `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_CHAT_IDS` (comma-separated for multiple admins).
4. After deploy, register the webhook with Telegram:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/setWebhook" \
  -d "url=https://<your-railway-domain>/api/telegram/webhook" \
  -d "secret_token=$TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
```

5. Send `/start` to your bot. The webhook verifies the secret header and that your chat ID is in `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_CHAT_IDS` before executing any command.

### Available commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/start` `/help` | Show this command list |
| `/status` | Site stats: users, transactions, active tokens, toggles, banner |
| `/users` | List registered users |
| `/balance <email>` | Show a user's crypto balances |
| `/credit <email> <SYM> <amount> [note]` | Credit a user with a deposit (real-time live price snapshot stored; email sent to user) |
| `/adjust <email> <SYM> <±amount> [reason]` | Adjust a user's position up or down (e.g. apply yield/ROI); shows on user dashboard instantly + email |
| `/issue_token <email> [SYM] [maxAmount]` | Issue a single-use withdrawal authorisation token (emails the user) |
| `/tokens` | List all currently active withdrawal tokens |
| `/revoke <code>` | Revoke an active token |
| `/tx [n]` | Show the last *n* transactions across the platform |
| `/address <SYM> <addr> [memo=…] [network=…] [label=…]` | Publish a deposit wallet address for an asset (instantly visible on every user's dashboard) |
| `/addresses` | List all currently published deposit addresses |
| `/remove_address <SYM>` | Remove a published deposit address |
| `/maintenance on\|off` | Toggle site-wide maintenance banner |
| `/withdrawals on\|off` | Globally enable / disable withdrawals |
| `/signups on\|off` | Globally enable / disable new signups |
| `/banner <text>` (or `clear`) | Set a gold notice banner on every page |
| `/broadcast <text>` | Push a real-time notice to the site (read via `/api/settings`) |

Toggles take effect within seconds — the `<SiteBanner />` component polls `/api/settings` every 15s and the API routes themselves read settings on every request, so `/maintenance on` instantly blocks withdrawals across the platform.

## How to Deploy on Railway

1. **Create a new project** on [railway.app](https://railway.app) and connect this GitHub repository.
2. **Attach a volume**: Go to **Volumes** → **New Volume** → mount at `/data`. This persists user data across redeploys.
3. **Set environment variables**: In **Variables**, add at minimum:
   - `DATA_DIR=/data`
   - `SESSION_SECRET=<random-32-char-string>`
   - `JWT_SECRET=<random-string>`
   - `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<random-string>`
   - `ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@aurumx.com`
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD=<secure-password>`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://<your-railway-domain>.railway.app`
4. **Deploy**: Railway auto-detects Next.js and runs `npm ci && npm run build`, then starts with `npm run start`.
5. **Add a custom domain** (optional): Under **Settings** → **Domains**, add `aurumx.app` or your preferred domain.

After deployment, if you configured Telegram, register the webhook:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/setWebhook" \
  -d "url=https://<your-domain>/api/telegram/webhook" \
  -d "secret_token=$TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
```

Then send `/start` to your bot.
